# 100 Taps
Test your tapping techinique with 100 Taps! This game has two modes: Classic mode, where you race against the clock to tap 100 times as fast as you can, and Timed mode, where you aim to get as many taps as possible in a time limit of 15 seconds. Play again and again to try to beat your highscore!

This is the first game with graphics I ever created! I originally made it with Pythonista for iOS sometime in 2015, then I revised it in February 2019 for efficiency and support for different screen sizes.
